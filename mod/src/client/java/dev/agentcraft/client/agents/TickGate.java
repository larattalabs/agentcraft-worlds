 * Lets an agent advance at most once per client tick, whichever path gets there first.

 * <p>An agent normally advances in its entity tick ({@link ClientAgentEntity#tick}). Mods that skip
 * ticking entities the player can't see (Entity Culling's {@code tickCulling}, on by default) would
 * freeze it there, so {@link AgentManager} also offers every agent a catch-up at the end of each client
 * tick. Both paths {@link #claim} the same tick number; only the first one advances. Pure: no Minecraft
 * state, unit-tested in {@code TickGateTest}.
